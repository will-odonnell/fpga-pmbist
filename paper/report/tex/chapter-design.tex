\chapter{Proposed Design}
\label{chap:design}

The design is based on \cite{1584083} which proposes a programmable memory BIST with auxillary memory for NPSF.  This design will modify the programmable memory BIST by introducing an LFSR to dynamically generate the NPSF patterns for 2-D and 3-D memories, and replace the address generator with a programmable address counter to allow more flexibility in testing specific addresses.
