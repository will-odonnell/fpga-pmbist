\chapter{Proposed Design}
\label{chap:design}
The design in this report is based upon a design for a programmable memory BIST with auxiliary memory for background patterns \cite{1584083}.  This design (proposed design) will modify the programmable memory BIST design (base design) by introducing a pattern generator to dynamically generate the NPSF Type-1 neighborhood patterns.  It will also replace the address counter with a programmable address generator to allow more flexibility in testing specific address sequences.  Section \ref{sect:bg-blocks} describes the base design's major blocks in more detail.  Details of the proposed design's modifications follow in Section \ref{sect:bg-modifications}.
