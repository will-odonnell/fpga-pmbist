\chapter{Proposed Design}
\label{chap:design}

The design in this report is based upon \cite{1584083} which proposes a programmable memory BIST with auxillary memory for NPSF.  This design will modify the programmable memory BIST by introducing a pattern generator to dynamically generate the NPSF Type-1 neighborhood patterns.  It will also replace the address counter with a programmable address generator to allow more flexibility in testing specific addresses sequences.
