\section{PMBIST Motivation}
\label{sect:int-motivation}

A non-programmable MBIST requires the designer to correctly predict the fault models to be tested.  Changes to the design or mask typically requires another tape-out and can be quite expensive.  A PMBIST provides designers and manufacturers the flexibility to modify memory test algorithms to detect and possibly repair defects found during chip manufacturing that were not in the original fault models.  The new algorithm can be initiated through a scan mechanism, but relying solely on scan can be time consuming for serial BIST schemes \cite{748806}.
