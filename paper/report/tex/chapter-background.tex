\chapter{Memory BIST Fundamentals}
\label{chap:background}
Memory testing has many parts, but in general there are three components: the test algorithm or operations performed in each cell; the data written or read from the cell; and, the memory address sequence or counting method \cite{5993815}.  The basic concept is to confirm that a value written to a memory address is still present in that memory address at any point in the future.  Many factors can affect the ability of the memory to retain its proper value.  Those factors manifest as one of the four standard memory faults: Stuck-At Faults, Transitional Faults, Coupling Faults and Neighborhood Pattern-Sensitive Faults \cite{VanDeGoor1991}. All current BIST engines are able to detect these faults with varying degrees of effectiveness.  The BIST engines use memory test algorithms to detect, and in some cases, repair these faults.    

The address counting method and address order are major factors in a test algorithm's ability to detect these faults.   A BIST needs an address generator that can produce the correct sequence of addresses without omitting any addresses.
