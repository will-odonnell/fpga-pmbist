\section{Memory Test Algorithms}
\label{sect:bg-algorithms}
The early tests before the 1980’s were not based on fault models or proofs.  Tests of this time, such as Scan, GALPAT and Walking, were considered Ad-Hoc and usually have very long test times of order O(n2) making the non-ideal for larger memories \cite{1327984}.  The introduction of fault models in the early 1980’s allowed the fault coverage to be mathematically proven.  This paved the way for March tests to become the dominant type of tests since its fault coverage is proven mathematically and its test time is linear to the size of the memory \cite{1327984}.
