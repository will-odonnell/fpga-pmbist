\subsection{Walking Algorithms}
Walking algorithms are similar to GALPAT tests.  They begin by initializing all memory to zeroes and then complement the first test cell, or base cell.  The test reads the base cell and then reads each of the memory cells to compare results without re-reading the base cell.  The test effective for finding stuck-at faults, but also suffers from test times proportional to O(n2) \cite{oldref-10}.
