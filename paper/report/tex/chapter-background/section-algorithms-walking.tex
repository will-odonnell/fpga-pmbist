\subsection{Walking Algorithms}
Walking algorithms are similar to GALPAT tests.  They begin by initializing all memory to zeros and then complement the first test cell, or base cell.  The test reads the base cell and then reads each of the memory cells to compare results without re-reading the base cell.  The test is effective at finding SAF, but suffers from test times proportional to \textit{O(n\textsuperscript{2})} \cite{VanDeGoor1991}.
