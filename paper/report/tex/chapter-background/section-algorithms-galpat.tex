\subsection{GALPAT and variations}
The GALPAT or Galloping 1’s and 0’s algorithm sequences through all memory addresses to test for faults.  It starts by writing a background of zeroes into all memory cells, then complements the first cell and compares it to every other cell, reading the base and test cell every time.  The test continues testing every cell by complementing the current cell and comparing it to every other cell \cite{oldref-09}.  The test is effective for finding stuck-at faults, coupling faults and transition faults, but suffers from an extremely long test time compared to march tests \cite{1327984}.
