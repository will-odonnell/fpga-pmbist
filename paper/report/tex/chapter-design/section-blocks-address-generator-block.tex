\subsection{Address Generator Block}
\label{sect:bg-blocks-address-generator}
The memory address to test and memory control signals are generated by the address and operation block.  The address decode block is used to generate the instruction register hold signal.  The hold signal maintains the instruction register's data until the current March sequence has completed for all memory address.  

\subsubsection{Address Counter}
The address counter indicates the memory address to test.  The direction of the address order can be programmed to increment or decrement through memory.  The CM is also programmable: linear up/down, pseudo-random sequence using LFSR, address complement, Gray coding, and 2\textsuperscript{i} CMs.  The address counter is used as an input to the circuits that generate the address complement, Gray coding  and 2\textsuperscript{\textit{i}} CM.  The address generator is described in more detail in Section \ref{sect:bg-modifications}.
 
\subsubsection{Address Decode Logic}
The address decode logic block determines if the address generated by the address counter is the last up (LU) or last down (LD) memory address for the current March sequence.  The decode logic uses the signals from the address programmer block to determine whether the sequence direction is up or down.
