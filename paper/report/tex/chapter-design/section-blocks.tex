\section{PMBIST Hardware Blocks}
\label{sect:bg-blocks}
The proposed design is comprised of five major blocks: the scan and instruction register; the cycle controller; the address generator block; the data generator and compare block; and the operation control block.  The major blocks and their connections are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:pmbistall} and the following sections offer a more detailed description of the blocks.
