\section{Modifications to Programmable MBIST}
\label{sect:bg-modifications}
These modifications were made to the design.

\subsection{Address Generator Expansion}
The address generator originally supported linear and pseudo-random address counting methods.  Now it supports a wide range of counting methods.

\subsection{Programmable Address Generator}
Added ability to select which address generation pattern would be used.  The instruction register was expanded to add new fields for address generation.

\subsection{Dynamic Background Pattern Generation}
Replaced the auxiallary memory with an LFSR to generate the patterns instead to save memory.

\subsection{3-D Memory Background Pattern Generation}
The 2-D background pattern generation is expanded to support 3-D background patterns.
