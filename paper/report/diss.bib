abstract={Due to the rapid decrease of technology feature size speed related faults, such as Address Decoder Delay Faults (ADDFs), are becoming very important. In addition, increased leakage currents demand for improved tests for Bit Line Imbalance Faults (BLIFs)(caused by memory cell pass transistor leakage). This paper contributes to new and improved algorithms for detecting these faults. First it provides an improved version of existing GalPat algorithm and introduces two new algorithms to detect ADDFs; the paper also shines a new light on the use of the different stress combinations (counting methods, data-backgrounds) and their importance for the detection of ADDFs. Second, it provides an improved algorithm for detecting BLIFs; it increases the defect coverage by being able to detect lower leakage currents.},

Each test algorithm is used with up to 16 different stress combinations (SCs) (i.e. different address sequences, data backgrounds and voltages) resulting in 122 tests. The results show that SCs influence the fault coverage (FC) of the test algorithms, that the highest FC is obtained at a low voltage level and that the highest detected number of unique faults is obtained at a high voltage level. They also show that the tests with the most promising FC, based on the theory, also tend to have the highest FC in practice. Moreover, the test results show that some algorithms detect faults that cannot be explained with the existing fault models, indicating that the existing fault models still leave much to be explained; for example, no theoretical basis exists to model the stresses and the predicted FC for a given test.},

A new synthesis procedure for a n-size LFSR is given and guarantees that a deterministic set of n precomputed test pairs is embedded in the maximal length pseudo-random test sequence of the LFSR. Sufficient and necessary conditions for the synthesis of this pseudo-deterministic LFSR are provided and show that at-speed delay faults testing becomes a reality without any additional cost for the LFSR. Moreover, since the theoretical properties of LFSRs are preserved, our method could be beneficially used in conjunction with any other technique proposed so far},

abstract={The March algorithm based built-in self-test (BIST) schemes have been widely used to test memory chips (cores). Conventional methods which use binary counters to generate the addresses may require large routing area when the addresses are to be broadcast to multiple memory cores. In this paper we propose to use linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) to generate the memory addresses which can be serially applied to the memory cores under test and thus the routing area overhead can be greatly reduced. We have designed a complete up/down LFSR which can generate complete March addresses, including all 2 n up and 2 n down sequences. Also theoretic analysis has been done which guarantees the transitions from up to down and down to up sequences can all be smoothly carried out such that the memory under test can receive a different address per clock cycle even during the transitions.},

year={2008}, 
volume={57}, 
number={3}, 
pages={651-663}, 
abstract={This paper addresses the optimization of very large scale integration testing systems, specifically the structure design and optimization of a built-in self-test (BIST) design based on two-dimensional (2D) linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs). The 2D LFSRs can generate both precomputed test patterns (for detecting random-pattern-resistant faults) and random patterns (for detecting random-pattern-detectable faults) and have the advantages of high fault coverage and at-speed testing. To guarantee solutions, it is necessary and desirable to generate subsequences of the precomputed test patterns through the 2D LFSRs, where these subsequences retain the order of the test patterns, particularly for testing sequential circuits. For the design and optimization of the 2D LFSRs, the following two problems need to be solved: 1) the good partitioning of the precomputed test patterns into disjoint subsequences in order to achieve a minimal hardware and 2) the structure design and optimization of the 2D LFSRs to generate the test patterns in each partitioned subsequence. The optimization of the 2D LFSRs is modeled as an integer program (a logic optimization model) that determines the coefficients of the recursive Boolean equations that govern the generation of the test patterns. For a sequence of the test patterns, this model finds the minimal-hardware implementation of the 2D LFSRs. This logic optimization model can be applied to both test-per-scan (serial BIST) and test-per-clock (parallel BIST). This paper presents how this model is embedded in a heuristic framework to partition the test patterns into subsequences from the configurable 2D LFSRs. The testing hardware is small as the configurable architecture allows the tester to incrementally generate the precomputed test patterns by modification to the feedback of the 2D LFSRs. Results of benchmark circuits show that significant hardware reduction and higher fault coverage are achieved. The resulting multisequence test gene- - rator is a regular structure and is easy to implement. The logic optimization model is applicable to both completely and partially specified test patterns and can be adopted for other LFSR-based structure design and optimization.},

abstract={In recent years, embedded memories are the fastest growing segment of system on chip. They therefore have a major impact on the overall Defect per Million (DPM). Further, the shrinking technologies and processes introduce new defects that cause previously unknown faults; such faults have to be understood and modeled in order to design appropriate test techniques that can reduce the DPM level. This paper discusses a new memory fault class, namely dynamic faults, based on industrial test results; it defines the concept of dynamic faults based on the fault primitive concept. It further shows the importance of dynamic faults for the new memory technologies and introduces a systematic way for modeling them. It concludes that current and future SRAM products need to consider testability for dynamic faults or leave substantial DPM on the table, and sets a direction for further research.},

Two linear test algorithms that cover 100% of the faults under the fault model are proposed.

In addition defect types are becoming more complex and diverse and may escape detection during fabrication test, leading to field failures due to the use of faulty components in final products. As a matter of fact memories have to be tested by test algorithms achieving very high fault coverage for a increasingly complex faults. Fixing the test algorithm during the design phase may not be compatible with this goal, as unexpected failures not covered by this algorithm may be occur during production. Also, having the possibility to select the memory test algorithm after fabrication is very important during the initial phase of a new process node (both process debug and production ramp-up). Programmable BIST approaches, allowing selecting after fabrication a large variety of memory tests, are therefore desirable, but may lead on unacceptable area cost. BIST approaches enabling test algorithm programmability and data background programmability at low area cost have been presented in the past. However, no proposals exist for programming the address sequence used by the test algorithm. In this paper we expend programmable BIST to include address programmability. This new feature is implemented at low cost by using the memory under test itself to store the desired address sequence and some compact circuitry that enables using this sequence for testing the memory.},

abstract={A practical microprogram ROM BIST (built-in self-test) scheme suitable for LSI memories is proposed. This BIST can be used to install N-pattern and N2-pattern test procedures, using BIST circuits with 12-word×10-b and 16-word×16-b ROMs, respectively. As a practical test procedure, a data retention test, in which BIST circuits with an 8-word×11-b ROM were used, was investigated. BIST circuit area overheads for the above three test patterns for 16-Mb DRAMs are less than 1%, 2%, and 1.5%, respectively. A testing method for the BIST circuits themselves, with no special BIST circuit overhead, is also proposed for more practical applications. The measured operational margin for a 16-Mb DRAM using the BIST showed a good agreement with that using an LSI tester},

abstract={The design and architectures of a microcode-based memory BIST and programmable FSM-based memory BIST unit are presented. The proposed microcode-based memory BIST unit is more efficient and flexible than existing architectures. Test logic overhead of the proposed programmable versus nonprogrammable memory BIST architectures is evaluated. The proposed programmable memory BIST architectures could be used to test memories in different stages of their fabrication and therefore result in lower overall memory test logic overhead. We show that the proposed microcode-based memory BIST architecture has better extendibility and flexibility while having less test logic overhead than the programmable PSM-based memory BIST architecture},

abstract={A built-in self-test engine and test methodology have been developed for testing a family of high-bandwidth, high-density DRAM macros. The DRAM macros range in size from 256×16×128 to 2 K×16×256 (Word×Bit×Data) and are targeted for embedded applications in application-specific integrated circuit designs. The processor-based test engine, with two separate instruction storage memories, combines with flexible address, data, and clock generators to provide DRAM high-performance ac testing using a minimum of dedicated test pins. Test results are compressed through on-macro, two-dimensional, redundancy allocation logic to provide direct programming information for the fuser via a serial scan port. The design is intended for reuse on future DRAM-generation subarrays and can be adapted to any number of address or data-pin configurations},

abstract={The design of minimum-length test sequences for pattern sensitivity in random-access memory (RAM) arrays is examined. The single pattern-sensitive fault (SPSF) model is used in which operations addressed to at most one memory cell are allowed to be faulty at any time. The influence of an SPSF affecting cell Ci is restricted to a fixed set of cells called the neighborhood of Ci. A new method is presented for efficiently generating the sequence of writes required in an SPSF test. This method yields optimal sequences for a useful class of neighborhoods called tiling neighborhoods. It is observed that RAM neighborhoods can be interpreted as polyominoes. A general procedure is given for constructing an SPSF test containing the minimum number of writes but a nonminimum number of reads. The difficult problem of minimizing the number of reads in an SPSF test is investigated for the 2-cell memory M2. A test of length 36 for M2 is derived which is optimal under certain reasonable restrictions. It is demonstrated that minimum-length SPSF tests can be inherently asymmetric.},
